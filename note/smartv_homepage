YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST TPV FOR ANY DAMAGE, COSTS OR DISSATISFACTION CAUSED BY ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PORTAL, OR OF ANY OF THE APPS, WEBSITES OR CONTENT, IS TO STOP USING THE PORTAL OR THE RESPECTIVE APPS, WEBSITE, SERVICES OR CONTENT. </p><br><p style="margin:0">7. Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and defend us and hold us harmless against all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, expenses, damages and costs, including any reasonable legal fees, resulting or arising from or relating to your access to or use of the Portal, Websites, Services or Content, your conduct on the Portal, any activity related to your account (in the case of Single Sign-On) by you or any other person, any material that you submit to, post on or transmit through the Portal, your breach of these Terms or your infringement or violation of any rights of another party.</p><br><p style="margin:0">8. Limitation on Access and Export Control. We reserve the right (but will not have any obligation) to refuse access to APPs on the Portal. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve and disclose any usage information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users and the public. We may, at our sole discretion, add or remove access to any of the APPs or websites in the Portal at any time. </p><br><p style="margin:0">Furthermore, we reserve the right, at any time and at our sole discretion, to limit the availability and accessibility of the Portal to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose. The Portal is subject to the export control laws of, among others, the Netherlands and the United States, and may not be accessed by (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) a national or resident of Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By using the Portal, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list. Use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in these Terms and any amendments hereto, as applicable.</p><br><p style="margin:0">9. Changes to Device, Portal and/or Terms. We may, at our discretion, change, <span>update</span> or upgrade features or the software of the Device or the Portal, for example by adding or removing APPs or features or by providing you with an update to the software. If such changes have an impact on these Terms, you will receive a notice about the updating of these Terms. You understand and agree that if you use the Portal after the date on which the Terms change, we will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms. </p><br><p style="margin:0">10. Single Sign-On. We may choose to provide you with a single sign-on option in the Portal. This option will offer you the possibility of linking your access to and use of multiple features of the Portal to a single user account. You are responsible for safeguarding the username and password that you have selected for this account. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p><br><p style="margin:0">11. Payment Services. Our Content Partners may offer you paid Content. If you wish to purchase paid Content from a Content Partner, you will need to enter into a separate agreement with such Content Partner. We are not part of that agreement, and we do not bear any liability for such an agreement. You can make a payment using either the Smart TV Payment Service or, if the Content Partner uses a third-party payment service provider, the payment service offered by the Content Partner. You shall be responsible for all charges incurred through your payment account, as well as for paying any applicable taxes. We provide the Smart TV Payment Service to you subject to your acceptance of the current Smart TV Payment Terms of Use. If you wish to use the payment service offered by the Content Partner, you may need to open an account with a third-party payment service provider. When you open this account, this payment service provider will require that you accept separate terms and conditions that are applicable to its payment service. </p><br><p style="margin:0">12.

We reserve the right to remove comments and content that you have posted or displayed on the Portal that allegedly infringe the rights of third parties, without prior notice and at our sole discretion. Conversely, should you find that someone else has posted, submitted or uploaded content, or is using content, that infringes your intellectual property rights, you can let us know via the feedback function using the blue button on your remote control unit.</p><br><p style="margin:0">14. Governing Law. Your agreement with us shall be governed by and is construed under and in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands, excluding its conflict of law provisions. The court of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, shall be the only competent court to settle any disputes between you and us arising out of or relating to the Agreement, unless applicable mandatory consumer law requires otherwise.</p><br><p style="margin:0">15. Miscellaneous. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. No addition to or removal or modification of any of the provisions of these Terms will be binding upon us, unless made in writing and signed by our authorised representative.

We have signed mandatory data processor agreements with such parties in order to protect the data and limit the use thereof. <br><br>§ About the Privacy Statement<br>When Smart TV is started for the first time, the TV will connect to our servers to register. During this registration process, our servers will allocate several unique numbers to the TV so that it can be recognised when it connects to the servers again. That way, you do not have to go through the registration process each time Smart TV is started subsequently. <br><br>These numbers are used by the servers to recognise the TV so the servers know what APPs have been installed, where they are located on the Smart TV Portal, whether you have registered for Smart TV payment and which websites have been saved in the browser. If you register a tablet or smartphone with the TV, for example in order to use the "MyRemote APP", a unique number is allocated to the mobile device as well so it can be recognised when it is used again. <br><br>If you enable "Personal Recommendations" during the Smart TV registration process, the TV will monitor a number of elements of the user's viewing behaviour. These elements are: the moment the TV is switched on and off, the TV programmes that are watched regularly when selected via the electronic programming guide, online programmes watched via the Smart TV Portal (for example catch-up TV) and any films ordered via the Smart TV Portal. Our servers then use this information to make recommendations and send them back to the TV. <br><br>Furthermore, aggregated statistics are gathered about overall use of the Smart TV Portal. We use such statistics to maintain the Smart TV Portal, find and correct errors and generally improve the Smart TV Portal offering and experience. <br><br>We generally do not keep personal data for more than three months, after which this data is either destroyed or made anonymous. This may not be the case in certain limited instances, for example if the deletion would have a negative impact on the user experience (e.g. remembering which APPs have been installed), or in the case of details on financial transactions, which must be kept on file for legal reasons. We have also formalised these arrangements with the third-party suppliers. <br><br>Personal data can also be deleted by the user by selecting the option "Delete Internet history" or "Reinstall device" from the configuration menu on the TV. We strongly suggest that users use this option when selling or giving away the TV. <br><br>§ About the Cookie Policy<br>In order to provide the Smart TV services, we use a number of cookies. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your TV by our servers. When you use Smart TV, the following cookies may be placed on your Device: <br>- Cookies used for the proper functioning of the Smart TV Portal;<br>- Cookies used to enhance the Smart TV experience. These are cookies that keep track of which apps you have installed and where you have placed these apps on the Portal, cookies that allow for a localised weather forecast to be shown on the Portal and cookies that are used to enable a link to be established with one or more of your social media apps;<br>- First- and Third-Party cookies to offer you (personalised) advertisements, keep track of which advertisements have been shown on your screen and make sure that advertisements are not repeated unnecessarily;<br>- Cookies that record your interactions (including viewing behaviour) in order to provide personal recommendations (if service is activated).<br><br>Non-functional cookies shall only be used after, and in line with, your consent to use such cookies during your initial registration for use on the Smart TV portal. <br><br>Cookies can be deleted using the "Delete Internet History" or "Reinstall Device" option in the configurations menu of the TV. We strongly recommend using the "Reinstall Device" option before you sell or give away your TV.  <br><br></span></p> <p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">PART 2<br>FULL-TEXT PRIVACY STATEMENT<br><br>IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT WE DESCRIBE HOW WE COLLECT, STORE OR OTHERWISE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA IN RELATION TO YOUR USE OF THE SMART TV PORTAL AND FOR WHICH SPECIFIC AND LEGITIMATE PURPOSES SUCH PROCESSING TAKES PLACE.

We will then tell you how we process this data and for what purposes. At the end of this privacy statement we will describe how we keep your data secure, whether data is transmitted outside of the European Union and how you can use your statutory rights to ask us to change or delete personal data. Please note that we are not responsible for all of the data processing described below. However, because this processing is related to your use of a Device, we have included a description of it in our privacy statement.<br><br>TP Vision may use third parties when providing you with the Smart TV Portal and services. These third parties may process your personal information for TP Vision if so instructed by TP Vision, but are not authorised to use such personal information for their own purposes. TP Vision remains responsible for ensuring that such information is handled in accordance with all applicable laws, and has signed dedicated processor agreements based on the EU Model Contracts for such agreements with such third parties for such purposes. <br><br>What types of data are collected?<br>Identification numbers<br>Consumer-ID: For each Device that is authenticated on a Device Portal, that Device Portal will generate and store a unique number to enable it to distinguish between different Device owners. This is the Consumer-ID. As explained below, the Consumer-ID may be linked to personal data provided by you during registration with My Philips or a customer loyalty programme or warranty registration from a Device Manufacturer. If you do not register for such a programme or for warranty purposes, the Consumer-ID is anonymous. Depending on your Device, Philips or the Device Manufacturer that manufactured your Device is the data controller for the Consumer-ID. We receive the Consumer-ID without the corresponding registration data. <br><br>Device-ID: For each Device that is authenticated on a Device Portal, that Device Portal will generate and store a fixed unique number to enable us to authenticate and identify the Device on the Platform. This number is called the Device-ID. We provide the Device-ID to selected content partners for authentication purposes. These content partners use the Device-ID to authenticate your Device for access to a Content Partner Website, provide us with viewing data for Video on Demand Titles and offer promotions and discounts. If you use a Mobile Device to use some Portal features, for example by using our "MyRemote APP", we will assign such use to the Device-ID of the Device in order to allow the Mobile Device to be identified by, and communicate with, the Device.<br><br>Mobile Device-ID: If you use a Mobile Device to use some Portal features, we will store a unique identifier for that Mobile Device in order to allow the Device to recognise and identify the Mobile Device.<br><br> Data collected during initialisation<br>Registration: When you initialise your Device you may be given the option to register your Philips Device with My Philips. For other Devices you may be given the option to register your Device with a customer loyalty programme from the Device Manufacturer or register your Device for warranty purposes with the Device Manufacturer. As part of this registration you will need to provide personal data, such as your name, email address and country of residence, and specific details about your Device such as type and serial number. Registration is not obligatory, and if you do not want to register, you can skip this registration.  This will not affect your use or your statutory warranty on the Device. As the personal data is sent directly to the Device Manufacturer, we do not receive or process any of the data relating to your registration. The Device Portal only transmits information to us regarding whether you have registered or not, and whether you have accepted the Portal terms and conditions. This information is linked to the Consumer-ID.<br><br>Portal sign-on data: Whenever you connect your Device to the Internet, it will automatically connect to its Device Portal. The Device Portal will authenticate your Device as being certified for access to the Portal. For authentication purposes, the Device Portal contains one or more unique numeric identifiers linked to your Device. Upon authentication your Device receives a Device-ID and will be redirected to the Portal. The Device Portal is managed by one of our outsourcing partners. If you do not have a Philips Device, the Device Portal can also be managed by the Device Manufacturer or by an outsourcing partner of the Device Manufacturer.<br><br>APP placement: As part of the standard functionality of the Portal you can manually arrange the order in which APPs are displayed on your home screen in the Portal. We will store your initial arrangement and any changes you make afterwards and link them to the Consumer-ID and the Device-ID.<br><br>Device-specific information: When you first log on to the Portal, the Device-ID is linked to a record of specific Device-related information. This information includes the Device type, and the language and country that have been configured on the Device.<br><br>Data collected during use<br>Advertising: In-video and display advertisements (banners) are supplied within the Portal, the IP-EPG and content that is accessible by means of Content Partner Websites. These advertisements are supplied by us, or by third parties using an advertising inventory assigned by us. All advertisements are supplied by means of, or via, our advertising server, which fulfils a co-ordinating role for the supply of advertisements. Our advertising server or the third-party advertising server will set a cookie on the Portal, the IP-EPG or a Content Partner Website. Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more information about these cookies.<br><br>Portal and Content Partner Website traffic, browser history and APP click behaviour: When you use the Portal you will generate direct Internet traffic between your Device and the Portal and Content Partner Websites that are accessible through the Portal. As part of this traffic we receive the IP address of your Internet connection and the language and country that have been configured on your Device. This information is stored in a database on the Platform. We also store IP addresses within the database of the IP-EPG server log. This information is stored for a period of time not exceeding three (3) months, after which the data is either deleted or anonymised. <br><br>Each URL that is entered by you in the navigation bar of the browser of your Device is stored on the Platform and linked to the Consumer-ID and the Device-ID. When you click on an APP we will only store this click and the date and time when you clicked. Your APP clicks are stored in a database record linked to the Consumer-ID and the Device-ID. This information is stored until you remove the bookmarked pages from the overview using the options menu that can be accessed using your remote control.<br><br> For data that is linked to the Consumer-ID and the Device-ID, you have the option to unlink it from those identifiers by means of the "Clear Net TV Memory" or "Reinstall Device" option in the menu on your Device. After unlinking, this data will no longer be linked to the Consumer-ID or the Device-ID, but may remain stored anonymously for aggregate statistics. Using the option to unlink the data not only deletes all cookies and local browser storage, but also unregisters your Device from any registrations. On newer Devices, this option is called "Reinstall Device". These newer Devices also have a "Clear App Memory" option, which deletes all cookies and local browser storage, but does not unregister your Device. It is highly advisable always to use "Clear Net TV Memory" or "Reinstall Device" prior to selling your Device or giving it away.<br>The Portal is managed by one of our outsourcing partners.<br>When you visit a Content Partner Website, the content partner in question will receive the IP address of your Internet connection and the language and country configured on your Device. We do not store or otherwise process actual Internet traffic between your Device and a Content Partner Website, nor can we view this traffic. The content partner is the data controller for any personal data it receives by means of a Content Partner Website.<br><br>Viewing behaviour: If you have activated personalised recommendations, we will periodically store viewing behaviour. By viewing behaviour we mean which television programmes were watched on or via your Device and how users of your Device change between television channels. In general, we periodically store the currently watched channel in a cookie on your Device. When this cookie is refreshed we receive a copy of the data stored in the cookie. This data is then stored within the recommendation engine of the Portal. The recommendation engine is part of the Platform and is responsible for providing Device-specific viewing recommendations in the Portal and in the electronic programming guide by translating the data into recommendations. The information about viewing behaviour is stored for a period of time not exceeding three (3) months, after which the data is either deleted or anonymised. If you use a Mobile Device to access the electronic programming guide feature, we will also store the system name of the Mobile Device. The recommendation engine is managed by one of our outsourcing partners.<br><br>Rented Video on Demand titles: Some content partners provide us with an overview of the rented Video on Demand titles for each Device-ID if such titles are ordered using Smart TV payment. This overview is subsequently stored within the recommendation engine for the purpose of making recommendations, and stored for a period of time not exceeding three (3) months, after which the data is either deleted or anonymised.<br><br>Catch-Up TV APP viewing data: Our Catch-Up TV APP, available in selected countries, enables you to obtain an overview of the most-viewed television programmes that have already been broadcast in your country. When this APP is used, we will store the television programmes that have been watched. This information is linked to the Device-ID and is subsequently stored within the recommendation engine for the purpose of making recommendations. The information is stored for a period of time not exceeding three (3) months, after which the data is either deleted or anonymised.<br><br>Data collected as part of Smart TV payment transactions: In the Portal we provide the possibility of opening a Smart TV payment account. When you open an account you will be asked to provide your name, country of residence and email address and information related to the payment method you wish to use (credit card, bank debit etc.). For security purposes we will link your payment account to the Device-ID of your Device. Any data that we store in relation to a Smart TV payment account is processed by our payment service provider in accordance with all applicable security standards, as we will explain further below, and stored in accordance with the retention requirements dictated by law for financial transactions. <br><br>Smart TV ID for establishing a link with social media applications: Specifically for the social TV applications provided by us, such as 'Social TV Share' (links with Facebook and Twitter), 'Social TV' (links with Facebook and Twitter) and 'Cloud Explorer' (links with Dropbox). The first time you launch one of these applications, you will be prompted to create a Smart TV ID. The Smart TV ID is a combination of a unique identifier, a chosen username, a chosen PIN, a photo source and authentication codes for Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox. This information is stored in a cookie on your Device (the 'socialtv cookie'). This Smart TV ID is then used to establish a link between one or more of our social TV applications and your account with Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox. It is possible to create multiple Smart TV IDs per Device for different users. If you choose not to create a Smart TV ID, no automatic link will be established with your Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox account. Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more information about the socialtv cookie and the use thereof.<br><br>What do we do with the data we collect?<br>We process collected data for the following purposes:<br>§ Maintaining and operating the Portal: We use the IP address, Consumer-ID, Device-ID and country and language configured on your Device to provide your Device with access to the Portal and Content Partner Websites, and provide it with the correct APP view. This includes but is not limited to use for the purposes of authentication, abuse handling, management of security incidents, monitoring of availability of the Portal and Content Partner Websites and providing backup services for user preferences.<br>§ Optimising the Portal user experience: We use aggregate and anonymised usage data like APP click behaviour, APP preferences, browser history and your interaction with the Portal to improve and further develop the Portal user experience.<br>§ Payment Transactions: We use the information in your Smart TV payment account to process and authorise your payment transactions.<br>§ Improving open Internet browsing: We use your browser history to enable us to generate thumbnails for URLs that have been entered in the navigation window of the browser of the Device and to enable an autocomplete function for these URLs.<br>§ Optimising advertisement experience: We use data related to advertising views and clicks on advertisements to optimise consumers' advertising experience in the Portal.<br>§ Device-specific viewing recommendations: Provided you have activated personalised viewing recommendations in the Portal, we use the viewing behaviour, rented Video on Demand titles, Catch-Up TV and APP viewing data related to your Device-ID to generate Device-specific recommendations for viewing television programmes and Video on Demand in the recommendations section of the Portal and the IP-EPG.<br>§ Discounts: We provide the Device-ID to selected content partners to enable these partners to identify to what extent they can provide you with free access to Video on Demand titles in their collections.<br>§ Supply of Advertisements: We use the information in the aforementioned advertising cookies to allow the system to log which advertisements have been shown on your Device in order to make sure that you do not receive too many similar advertisements, and to allow us to comply with our commercial arrangements with our advertising partners. External advertisers that supply advertisements on the Portal, the IP-EPG or Content Partner Websites after co-ordination by our advertising server may also use cookies to track you over multiple websites, and to supply advertisements that reflect your personal preferences. <br>§ Authentication: We provide the Device-ID to selected Content Partners for authentication purposes.<br>§ Linking to Social Media Apps: If you have created one or more Smart TV IDs, the current Smart TV ID is used (after the PIN has been entered) when the 'Social TV Share', 'Social TV' and/or ‘Cloud Explorer’ application is started in order to establish an automatic link with the Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox account linked to that Smart TV ID. This means that you do not need to establish this link yourself every time you use these Social TV Applications.  <br>§ Law enforcement: We may be required to provide data to competent law enforcement officials or judicial authorities. If we do so it will always be subject to a binding legal instrument, such as a warrant or a judicial order, or other rule of applicable statutory law that would require us to co-operate with law enforcement or judicial authorities.<br><br> Is data transmitted outside of the European Union?<br>All personal data that is processed by us and by our outsourcing partners is stored and processed on servers that are based in the European Union or the United States of America. Where such personal data is transmitted to the United States of America, we shall ensure that the applicable outsourcing party either operates within the Safe Harbour Rules or is bound by adequate contractual documentation in line with mandatory EU model agreements. Furthermore, we use the AKAMAI content distribution system to ensure that content relating to the Portal is cached near the geographic location of your Device to improve speed and user experience. There are also AKAMAI servers outside of the European Union. Content distribution and dissemination via AKAMAI is initiated on the basis of your use of content that is accessible by means of the Portal. If a number of Devices request the same content, the AKAMAI system will automatically cache such content on a node that is geographically near to these Devices, e.g. if multiple TVs in Russia request content, content may be cached on an AKAMAI node that is located in Russia. For more information on AKAMAI, please visit http://www.akamai.com.<br><br> How secure is your personal data?<br>The connection between your Device and the Device Portal is encrypted. The state of this encryption has been audited by a reputable firm of auditors and has been confirmed to be suitably secure.<br>All Internet traffic between your Device, the Portal and the IP-EPG is secured by SSL (secure sockets layer) or an equivalent encryption technology. Whether or not a connection between your Device and a Content Partner Website is encrypted depends on the settings on the Content Partner Website. When your Device is connected to a Content Partner Website, you can check the encryption status of the connection in the Portal. Please check the manual of your Device.<br>Your stored personal data is maintained in a secure environment, which is regularly audited in accordance with accredited audit standards. Access to this data is password-protected and role-based, i.e. limited to our employees and those of our outsourcing partners who need to access it as part of their job description.<br>The credit card information you provide to us is stored in accordance with the most recent version of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS Tier 1). If you would like to know more about PCI-DSS, please visit https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/.<br><br>Contacting us<br>You can send us an email via privacy@tpvision.com in your own language. You can use this email address if you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, if you would like to request a copy of your personal data or if you want us to change or delete your personal data.<br><br></span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">PART 3<br>SMART TV COOKIE POLICY<br><br>IN THIS COOKIE POLICY WE DESCRIBE WHICH COOKIES WE SET ON YOUR DEVICE AND YOUR MOBILE DEVICE IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR USE OF THE SMART TV PORTAL. <br><br>WE ARE TP VISION EUROPE B.V.

The purpose of sending a cookie is to have the visiting browser return the text during any subsequent visits to that same web server. If the browser does so, it will enable the web server to recognise the browser and attach a set of actions and/or settings to its visit. The web browser stores the cookie.<br><br> We make a distinction between functional cookies and non-functional cookies. Functional cookies are cookies that are needed specifically for the purpose of enabling a Device to access and make use of the Portal and Content Partner Websites and for web servers to provide the right content to a Device. Non-functional cookies are all other cookies.<br><br>This Cookie Policy relates to cookies that are placed by us, as well as advertising cookies that may be placed by third parties on your Device. This Cookie Policy does not relate to cookies that may be placed when you use the Portal to access third-party websites or applications. For these cookies, we refer you to the respective cookie policies of such third parties.<br><br> If and to the extent that we process any personal data in relation to a cookie, our processing of such personal data is governed by our Privacy Statement. You can access our Privacy Statement at http://www.tpvision.com/legal-information/.<br><br> Which non-functional cookies do we use?<br>Viewing behaviour: If you have activated personalised recommendations, we will periodically store viewing behaviour. By viewing behaviour we mean which television programmes were watched on or via your Device and how users of your Device change between television channels. In general, we periodically store the currently watched channel in a cookie on your Device. When this cookie is refreshed we receive a copy of the data stored in the cookie. This data is then stored within the recommendation engine of the Portal for a period not exceeding three (3) months for the purpose of making personalised recommendations, after which the data is either deleted or anonymised. The recommendation engine is managed by one of our outsourcing partners. By opting in for personalised recommendations, you give us permission to set the cookie. We use the data that is included in the cookie to provide you with personalised viewing recommendations in the IP-EPG and in the Portal. You can manually deactivate the recommendations functionality at any time using the Options menu after placing the focus on the recommendations section on the Portal home screen.<br><br>Weather Forecast: In the top-right corner of the Portal a weather forecast is shown. To allow this weather forecast to be tailored to the generic location where the Device is being used (i.e. county or city), your Device will send a request for the weather forecast that includes your IP address. This IP address is used to determine your generic location, which then allows the server to send a location-specific weather forecast to your product. These details, as well as any other locations you may want to save, are then stored in a cookie on your Device and used to determine your generic location. <br><br>Advertising: In-video and display advertisements (banners) are supplied within the Portal, the IP-EPG and Content Partner Websites. These advertisements can be supplied by us or by third parties via, or as co-ordinated by, our advertising server, which performs a central co-ordinating role in relation to the supply of such advertisements. All advertisements will be supplied by means of our advertising server. <br><br>Our advertising server or a third-party advertising server will set a cookie on your Device. By means of this cookie, an ad server will register whether an advertisement has been supplied to your Device or whether someone using your Device has clicked on an advertisement. We use the information saved in this advertising cookie to record which advertisements have been supplied to your Device so we can make sure that not too many of the same advertisements are supplied to any particular Device, and so that we are able to comply with our commercial arrangements with our advertising partners. We shall not use this information to supply targeted advertisements. In addition to the foregoing, third parties may use our advertising system to supply advertisements on the Portal and the IP-EPG, as well as on Content Partner Websites, and place cookies on your Device when such advertisements are supplied. These are cookies from one or more of the following providers: <br><br>• Nuggad: http://www.nugg.ad/  <br>• Adnologies: http://ads.heias.com/ <br>• GroupM Targ.Ad: http://www.targad.info/ <br> • Google (DoubleClick): http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/ <br>• Adconion: http://adconiondirect.com/  <br><br>These cookies contain, among other things, information about the advertisements supplied, information on the application or domain in which such advertisements are supplied and your IP address. This is done to record how often a particular advertisement is shown, and in order to prevent the same advertisement being shown too often. External third-party advertisers that may place advertisements on the Portal, the IP-EPG or a Content Partner Website after co-ordination by our advertisement server may also use cookies to track your activity over multiple websites, and to provide advertisements that correspond to your personal preferences. <br><br>'Socialtv Cookie' (Smart TV ID) used for establishing a link with social media applications: Specifically for the social TV applications provided by us, such as 'Social TV Share' (which links with Facebook and Twitter), 'Social TV' (which links with Facebook and Twitter) and 'Cloud Explorer' (which links with Dropbox). You will be offered the opportunity to create a Smart TV ID when you first start one of these applications. The Smart TV ID is a combination of a unique identifier, a chosen username, a chosen PIN, a photo source and authentication codes for Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox. This information is stored on your Device in a cookie (the 'socialtv cookie'). <br><br>Every time you start one of the social TV applications, such as 'Social TV Share', 'Social TV' or 'Cloud Explorer', the application will read the cookie in order to establish a link between that application and your account with Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox. This way, you do not need to register with Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox again when using one of the social TV applications. If you delete the cookies on your Device by reinstalling the Device or deleting the Internet history, this cookie is also deleted. If you want to enable the link between the social TV applications and your account with Facebook, Twitter and/or Dropbox after that, you will need to create a new Smart TV ID. <br><br>Third-Party Websites<br>When you visit websites of third parties via your Device's internal browser, it is possible that such websites will place cookies on your device, and that such cookies will track and store your interactions on those websites. This does not happen at the request of TP Vision, and TP Vision does not use such information. We hereby refer you to the respective cookie and privacy policies of such websites for more information about the use of such cookies on and by such websites. <br><br>Cookie deletion<br>Your Device allows you to delete all cookies and other local browser storage from the Device. On older Devices, this can be done with the "Clear Net TV Memory" option in the menu on your Device. This option not only deletes all cookies and local browser storage, but also unregisters your Device from any registrations, for example for a Device manufacturer loyalty programme and for Smart TV Payments. On newer Devices, this option is called "Reinstall Device". These newer Devices also have a "Clear App Memory" option, which deletes all cookies and local browser storage, but does not unregister the Device. Deleting all cookies normally means that you have to log in again on all Apps. It is highly advisable always to use "Clear Net TV Memory" or "Reinstall Device" prior to selling or giving away your Device.<br><br> Contacting us<br>If you have any questions regarding our cookie policy, you can send us an email via privacy@tpvision.com in your own language.<br><br></span></p></div></div>
